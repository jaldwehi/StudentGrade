# StudentGrade - SWE 441 Assignment #1

## Overview
This repository is created as part of **Assignment #1** for the course *SWE 441: Software Maintenance and Evolution*. The main goal of the assignment is to perform a software maintenance task by upgrading the testing framework of a simple Java project called **StudentGrade**.

## Objectives
- Clone an existing project from GitHub.
- Reimplement the `StudentGradeTest` class using **JUnit 4 or 5** (instead of the original JUnit 3.8.1).
- Perform version control operations including branching, committing, merging, and pushing changes using Git and GitHub.

## Project Link
Cloned from: [https://github.com/nalmashfi/StudentGrade](https://github.com/nalmashfi/StudentGrade)

## Maintenance Type
This task demonstrates **Perfective Maintenance**, as we are improving the code without changing its functionality by upgrading to a newer testing framework.

## Tools Used
- Java (NetBeans IDE)
- JUnit 4/5
- Git & GitHub
